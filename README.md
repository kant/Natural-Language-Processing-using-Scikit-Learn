# Natural-Language-Processing-using-Scikit-Learn
Implementing Natural Langauge Processing in Python using the Natural Language ToolKit library, Naive Bayes classifier from Scikit-learn, and the concept of TF-IDF for normalization.


The project is being coded in Python3. In this project, we will be performing natural language processing using NLTK(Natural Language ToolKit), which is a library for performing symbolic and statistical NLP in the English language written in Python. 

 For weighting and normalization, the TF-IDF method will be used, this will be achieved by using scikit-learn's TfidfTransformer.

So what basically TF-IDF method is that we will be computing tf-idf weight, which is a weight which is often being used in information retrieval. This weight is used to evaluate the importance of words in the document to a document in a collection or corpus.
